# so from Census we have: 
# percent of households receiving foodstamp that are below the poverty level
# S2201_C01_021E = Total below poverty in the last 12 months
# S2201_C03_001E = Households receiving foodstamps 
# S2201_C01_001E = Total households

# Spatial autocorrelation
# probably a simple linear model 

# ratio SNAP::poverty for each county
