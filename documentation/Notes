# so from Census we have: 
# percent of households receiving foodstamp that are below the poverty level
# S2201_C01_021E = Total below poverty in the last 12 months
# S2201_C03_001E = Households receiving SNAP
# S2201_C01_001E = Total households

# Spatial autocorrelation
# probably a simple linear model 

# ratio SNAP::poverty for each county

# look at individual disasters (disasterNumber)

## QUIESTIONS/TASKS ##
# snap eligibility 
  # - gross income below 130% of the poverty line
  # - net income at or below poverty line 
  # - assets < certain amount 

# look at declarations 



# 1 - Compare poverty and snap rates across counties in 
  # TX that received major housing assistance declarations 
## - I think ratios (poverty:snap rates)

# -	Assess the strength or direction of the correlation between Poverty and SNAP assistance?
#   
# - What effect might an increase in the Poverty rate have on the SNAP Benefits rate?
#   
# -	Can you imagine a way to complete this task with another method? If time allows, feel free to talk to said method.
